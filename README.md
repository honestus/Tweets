# Tweets Analysis
This project has been developed to address the task of retrieving and analyzing tweets from Twitter API to match the requests of the [Big Data Analytics](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/masters/master-artificial-intelligence/curriculum/syllabus/BDA-MAI) course from the Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence at UB/UPC/URV.
## What is this project about?
It consists of <b>different kind of analysis made on Tweets objects</b>, such as:
* the languages they're written in;
* the sources(i.e. the devices/apps) they're written through;
* their number of retweets/responses; 
* a deeper analysis on the text(s) features. 

All the tasks have been done by using <b>Python</b>, with its useful pandas, numpy, scikit-learn libraries, and <b>MongoDB</b> for storing the retrieved tweets (both queried in real time or previously tweeted ones). 
Finally, to address the assignment of analyzing texts, it's been crucial the usage of nltk package.
